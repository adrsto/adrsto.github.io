Hi!

I'm Adrian, and I'm in the process of putting together *something* here. How it evolves from here will remain to be seen - I have some ideas for what I might want to do with it - but today's is about getting a system in place. 

In its current form, this is a static site powered by Jekyll and GitHub Pages.
